# Wage Trends Across U.S. Occupations

This repository contains my final project for MSBA 320 – Advanced Business Analytics using Python at Golden Gate University.

## 📊 Project Summary

Analyzed wage and employment disparities across U.S. occupations using the May 2024 OEWS dataset from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

### Key Techniques:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Analysis
- Linear Regression (OLS)
- ANOVA Testing
- Residual & Multicollinearity Diagnostics (VIF)

### Tools & Libraries:
Pandas, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

### Key Findings:
- Occupational classification (I_GROUP) significantly influences wage outcomes (p < 0.001)
- Total employment (TOT_EMP) has weak explanatory power for wages
- Visuals confirm right-skewed distributions and structural wage inequalities
